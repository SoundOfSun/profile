<h2>A short profile page</h2>

<p>This page was built as part of the 9-weeks <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">LeWagon Bootcamp</a> to practice front-end basics.<br>
I used HTML5, CSS3 and the Bootsrap library.</p>

<h4>Go check it out at this address: https://soundofsun.github.io/profile/</h4>

<p>PS: Except for the sidebar, all the links and buttons are dead ^^'<br>
If you would like to know more about me, please visit my portfolio website.</p>
